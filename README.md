## 📚 Overview

This repository contains small, self-contained examples that demonstrate TensorFlow fundamentals: tensor operations, building models from scratch, and basic training loops. Use these as learning resources or as templates for experiments.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

Recommended: create and activate a virtual environment (Windows example):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # PowerShell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install core dependency:

```powershell
pip install tensorflow
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

From repository root:

```powershell
cd tensorflow_basics
python linear_regression_tf.py
python tensor_operations.py
```

What to expect:

- linear_regression_tf.py — prints learned parameters (w, b) after training.
- tensor_operations.py — prints tensors and operation results.

---

## ✅ Learning goals

- Understand TensorFlow tensors and basic operations.
- Implement simple models and training loops using GradientTape.
- Use examples as starting points for experimentation and extensions.

---

## 💡 Best practices & tips

- Tweak learning rate and epochs in linear_regression_tf.py to observe training behavior.
- Keep experiments isolated in virtual environments.
- Use Git commit email that matches your GitHub account to reflect contributions on your profile.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (feature/bugfix)
3. Open a PR with a clear summary and tests/examples when relevant

Follow code style and add a short note in the module README for new projects.
