## 📚 What’s included

- Practical, minimal examples demonstrating TensorFlow fundamentals:
  - `linear_regression_tf.py` — linear regression from scratch (GradientTape)
  - `tensor_operations.py` — basic tensor ops (add, matmul)
  - `test.py` — placeholder for quick tests

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

Recommended to use a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install tensorflow
```

---

## ▶️ Run examples

From repository root:

```sh
cd tensorflow_basics
python linear_regression_tf.py
python tensor_operations.py
```

Expected outputs:

- `linear_regression_tf.py` — prints learned parameters (w, b)
- `tensor_operations.py` — prints tensor values and operation results

---

## 🧠 Notes & tips

- Modify learning rate and epochs in `linear_regression_tf.py` to observe different convergence behaviours.
- Use the examples as minimal templates to extend into larger experiments.
- Keep commits tied to an email verified on GitHub to ensure contributions appear on your profile.
